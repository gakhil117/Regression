# Regression

Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of regression analysis is to estimate the parameters of the model that best describe the relationship between the variables, and to use the model to make predictions about the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

There are several types of regression models, including:

Simple linear regression: This is a regression model with one independent variable and one dependent variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

Multiple linear regression: This is a regression model with multiple independent variables and one dependent variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

Polynomial regression: This is a regression model that uses a polynomial function to model the relationship between the variables.

Logistic regression: This is a regression model used for binary classification problems, where the dependent variable is a categorical variable with two possible outcomes.
